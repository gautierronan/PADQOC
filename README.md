# PADQOC

Parallel Automatic Differentiation Quantum Optimal Control (PADQOC) is a tool designed to high performance and extensible, useful for general quantum controls. Written in Python and built on top of Tensorflow 2.

## Background
Commonly used to design control pulses for a desired unitary when given system and control dynamics expressed in hamiltonian formalism.

### Features ###
* GPU computing
* Arbitrary parameterization basis
* Distributions of Drift and Control Hamiltonians
* Various optimizers

### Alternative tools and projects ###
* [Qutip](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-control.html) Quite a big library
* [Schuster's Lab Quantum Optimal Control](https://github.com/SchusterLab/quantum-optimal-control) A bit outdated
